It runs native applications with on-device Edge AI for real-time monitoring, alerts, task management, and Just-In-Time (JIT) guidance, primarily offline.")
display_term_sentinel_glossary("Edge AI / TinyML", "Artificial Intelligence models (e.g., using TensorFlow Lite, MicroPython for microcontrollers, or optimized libraries for mobile) designed to run directly on PEDs or local hubs with minimal computational resources, enabling offline decision support.")
display_term_sentinel_glossary("Supervisor Hub (Tier 1)", "An optional intermediary device (e.g., a more capable smartphone or tablet) used by a team leader. It locally aggregates data from team PEDs via short-range communication (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct) for localized oversight, basic team analytics, and can facilitate batched data transfer to a Facility Node.")
display_term_sentinel_glossary("Facility Node (Tier 2)", "A local server, PC, or robust device (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Intel NUC) typically situated at a clinic or community health center. It aggregates data from multiple Supervisor Hubs or directly from PEDs (via opportunistic sync). It performs more complex local analytics, can interface with local EMRs/HIS (if they exist), generates reports for clinic management and DHOs, and acts as a staging point for wider data synchronization to regional or cloud systems.")
display_term_sentinel_glossary("Regional/Cloud Node (Tier 3)", "Optional centralized infrastructure (e.g., cloud servers or national data centers) for population-level analytics, epidemiological surveillance, advanced AI model refinement, and national health reporting. Receives batched, processed data from Facility Nodes.")

This is crucial for environments with constrained input capabilities and bandwidth. Examples include critical vital sign thresholds (e.g., SpO2 < {getattr(app_config, 'ALERT_SPO2_CRITICAL_LOW_PCT', 'N/A')}%), key symptom flags, basic demographics like age group, and high-impact contextual factors.", "Section IV of app_config.py (conceptual list)")

On a PED, this code is mapped by the native application to a specific pictogram, a Just-In-Time (JIT) guidance sequence (e.g., simplified SOP steps), an automated communication trigger (like an SMS template), or a pre-defined checklist.")
display_term_sentinel_glossary("Opportunistic Sync", "A data synchronization strategy where PEDs, Hubs, and Nodes attempt to transfer data only when a viable, low-cost, or available communication channel is detected. This can include Bluetooth, local Wi-Fi Direct, physical SD card transfer ('sneaker-net'), batched SMS for critical summaries, or brief periods of cellular/internet connectivity.")
