display_term_sentinel(
    term="Sentinel Health Co-Pilot", 
    definition="An edge-first health intelligence and action support system. It's designed for resource-limited, high-risk LMIC environments, prioritizing offline functionality, actionable insights for frontline health workers (FHWs), and resilient data flow."
)
display_term_sentinel(
    term="Personal Edge Device (PED)", 
    definition="A ruggedized smartphone, wearable sensor array, or low-power System-on-Chip (SoC) device utilized by FHWs. It runs native applications featuring on-device Edge AI for real-time physiological monitoring, environmental sensing, alert generation, prioritized task management, and Just-In-Time (JIT) guidance protocols, primarily designed for offline operation."
)
display_term_sentinel(
    term="Edge AI / TinyML", 
    definition="Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, often leveraging frameworks like TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) or specialized TinyML libraries, that are optimized to execute directly on PEDs or local Supervisor Hubs. These models operate with minimal computational resources, enabling offline decision support, anomaly detection, and risk stratification at the point of care."
)
display_term_sentinel(
    term="Supervisor Hub (Tier 1)", 
    definition="An optional intermediary device (e.g., tablet, rugged phone) used by a CHW Supervisor or team leader. It locally aggregates data from team members' PEDs via short-range communication (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct), allowing for localized team oversight, simple dashboard views, and batched data transfer to higher tiers (Facility Nodes)."
)
display_term_sentinel(
    term="Facility Node (Tier 2)", 
    definition="A local server, PC, or robust computing device (e.g., Raspberry Pi, mini-PC) situated at a clinic, health post, or community health center. It aggregates data from Supervisor Hubs or directly from PEDs, can perform more complex local analytics, potentially interfaces with local Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), generates facility-level reports and dashboards (like the Clinic Console), and serves as a crucial staging point for wider data synchronization to regional or cloud systems."
)
display_term_sentinel(
    term="Regional/Cloud Node (Tier 3)", 
    definition="Optional centralized infrastructure, which can be an on-premise regional server or a cloud-based platform. This tier is designed for population-level analytics, epidemiological surveillance, advanced AI model training and refinement using aggregated data, and national-level health reporting. It receives batched data from multiple Facility Nodes."
)
display_term_sentinel(
    term="Lean Data Inputs", 
    definition=f"A core design principle focused on collecting only the minimum viable data points that possess maximum predictive power for Edge AI models and are directly actionable by FHWs.

    definition="A system-internal alphanumeric code (e.g., 'ACTION_SPO2_MANAGE_URGENT', 'TASK_VISIT_VITALS_URGENT') generated by an alert, an AI model output, or a task. On a PED, this code is mapped (e.g., via `pictogram_map.json` or `escalation_protocols.json`) to display a specific pictogram, trigger Just-In-Time guidance media, initiate an automated communication workflow, or guide the user through a step in a digital protocol."
)
display_term_sentinel(
    term="Opportunistic Sync", 
    definition="A data synchronization strategy where Sentinel devices (PEDs, Hubs, Facility Nodes) transfer data to higher tiers only when a viable, low-cost, and sufficiently stable communication channel becomes available. Examples include Bluetooth peer-to-peer, local Wi-Fi to a hub, brief windows of cellular connectivity, or even physical data transfer via SD card or QR code packets. This is vital for environments with intermittent, unreliable, or expensive internet access."
