# sentinel_project_root/test/__init__.py
# This file makes 'test' (your application root for these files) a Python package.
# This might be important if you ever need to import from 'test.config' or 'test.utils'
# from a script that is outside the 'test' directory but has 'sentinel_project_root' in its sys.path.
# For Streamlit apps where the main app script is inside 'test/', this might be less critical
# for the app's own internal imports but is good practice.
