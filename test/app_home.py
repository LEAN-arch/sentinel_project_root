st.markdown(f"""
    #### Welcome to the **{app_config.APP_NAME}** System Overview!
    
    This platform demonstrates key aspects of an **edge-first health intelligence system** designed for
    maximum clinical and operational actionability in resource-limited, high-risk LMIC environments.
    It aims to bridge advanced technology with real-world field utility, converting diverse data sources
    (wearables, IoT, contextual inputs) into life-saving, workflow-integrated decisions,
    with a strong emphasis on **offline-first capabilities** for frontline workers.

    **Core Principles Guiding the Sentinel System:**
    - **Edge-First, Offline Capable:** Intelligence and core functions reside on Personal Edge Devices (PEDs) for continuous operation without internet.
    - **Action-Driven Insights:** Focus on clear, targeted recommendations and automated alerts, not just data display.
    - **Human-Centered UX for Frontline:** PED interfaces are pictogram-based, use local languages, and support voice/tap interaction for high-stress, low-literacy environments.
    - **Resilient & Scalable Data Flow:** Modular architecture allows data synchronization from PEDs to Hubs, Facility Nodes, and potentially Regional/Cloud instances using appropriate technologies (Bluetooth, QR, SD card, SMS, opportunistic IP).

    üëà **The sidebar provides navigation to simulated web-based views for different operational tiers.**
    These views primarily represent what **Supervisors (Tier 1 Hubs), Clinic Managers (Tier 2 Facility Nodes),
    or District Health Officers (DHOs at Tier 2/3 Nodes)** would access. They are *not* representative of the
    native mobile/wearable application used by frontline health workers on their PEDs.
